# NTI Computer Vision Training 

During my training at the **NTI**, I had the incredible opportunity to explore the exciting world of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** through an intensive 90-hour training module. I gained a solid foundation in Neural Networks and Deep Learning, diving deep into **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and modern architectures such as **ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG16**.
I also worked extensively on **Image Processing, Feature Extraction, and Transfer Learning** techniques — applying them to **Image Classification, Object Detection, Segmentation, and Face Recognition projects** using **YOLO models**.
